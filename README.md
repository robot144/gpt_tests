__Content:__ Jupyter notebooks with chat-gpt api tests

## Example 1: test1_prompt_and_answer.ipynb
Explains how to use the chat-gpt API. It contains a few simple examples, but is fully functional, provided that you have an API-KEY. You can obtain an api-key by signing up to https://platform.openai.com and generating an api-key. Note that this will require a credit card. An overview of the pricing is given at https://openai.com/pricing The pricing is based on tokens. A token is roughly a syllable long.
